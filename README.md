## itunesclean

This app will remove tracks from iTunes that are no longer stored on the drive. Tracks with missing files contain the exclamation mark icon next to them, and iTunes provides no easy way to remove these tracks.

There are some paid utility apps in the App Store that will do this, but this app is free and open source

### Using

 1. Download the [latest release here](https://github.com/nikcub/itunesclean/raw/master/dist/itunesclean.zip)
 2. Open the zip file
 3. Drag the application to either your Desktop or the Applications folder
 4. Run it. It will prompt you before searching for tracks whose files have been removed

The application may take a moment to run.
